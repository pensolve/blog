## Usage

### 1. Install dependencies

Poole is built on Jekyll and uses its built-in SCSS compiler to generate our CSS. Before getting started, you'll need to install the Jekyll gem:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

**Windows users:** Windows users have a bit more work to do, but luckily [@juthilo](https://github.com/juthilo) has your back with his [Run Jekyll on Windows](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows) guide.

**Need syntax highlighting?** Poole includes support for Pygments or Rouge, so install your gem of choice to make use of the built-in styling. Read more about this [in the Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code_snippet_highlighting).

### 2. Running locally

To see your Jekyll site with Poole applied, start a Jekyll server. In Terminal, from `/poole` (or whatever your Jekyll site's root directory is named):

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voil√†.

### 3. Serving it up

If you host your code on GitHub, you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host your project.

1. Fork this repo and switch to the `gh-pages` branch.
  1. If you're [using a custom domain name](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages), modify the `CNAME` file to point to your new domain.
  2. If you're not using a custom domain name, **modify the `baseurl` in `_config.yml`** to point to your GitHub Pages URL. Example: for a repo at `github.com/username/poole`, use `http://username.github.io/poole/`. **Be sure to include the trailing slash.**
3. Done! Head to your GitHub Pages URL or custom domain.

No matter your production or hosting setup, be sure to verify the `baseurl` option file and `CNAME` settings. Not applying this correctly can mean broken styles on your site.

### 4. Updating

Simply download from the [Lanyon repo](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) as a ZIP, and unzip the contents, overwriting everything EXCEPT the config.yml and README.md.

## Options

Poole includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.


### Rems, `font-size`, and scaling

Poole is built almost entirely with `rem`s (instead of pixels). `rem`s are like `em`s, but instead of building on the immediate parent's `font-size`, they build on the root element, `<html>`.

By default, we use the following:

```css
html {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
@media (min-width: 38em) {
  html {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
}

```

To easily scale your site's typography and components, simply customize the base `font-size`s here.

### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.


### Themes

Lanyon ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add any one of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

```html
<body class="theme-base-08">
...
</body>
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/blob/master/public/css/lanyon.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.


### Reverse layout

Reverse the page orientation with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
...
</body>
```


### Sidebar overlay instead of push

Make the sidebar overlap the viewport content with a single class:

```html
<body class="sidebar-overlay">
...
</body>
```

This will keep the content stationary and slide in the sidebar over the side content. It also adds a `box-shadow` based outline to the toggle for contrast against backgrounds, as well as a `box-shadow` on the sidebar for depth.

It's also available for a reversed layout when you add both classes:

```html
<body class="layout-reverse sidebar-overlay">
...
</body>
```

### Sidebar open on page load

Show an open sidebar on page load by modifying the `<input>` to add the `checked` boolean attribute:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" checked>
```

Using Liquid you can also conditionally show the sidebar open on a per-page basis. For example, here's how you could have it open on the homepage only:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" {% if page.title =="Home" %}checked{% endif %}>
```
