## Usage

### 1. Install dependencies

Poole is built on Jekyll and uses its built-in SCSS compiler to generate our CSS. Before getting started, you'll need to install the Jekyll gem:

```bash
$ gem install jekyll
```

**Windows users:** Windows users have a bit more work to do, but luckily [@juthilo](https://github.com/juthilo) has your back with his [Run Jekyll on Windows](https://github.com/juthilo/run-jekyll-on-windows) guide.

**Need syntax highlighting?** Poole includes support for Pygments or Rouge, so install your gem of choice to make use of the built-in styling. Read more about this [in the Jekyll docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code_snippet_highlighting).

### 2. Running locally

To see your Jekyll site with Poole applied, start a Jekyll server. In Terminal, from `/poole` (or whatever your Jekyll site's root directory is named):

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and voilà.

### 3. Serving it up

If you host your code on GitHub, you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to host your project.

1. Fork this repo and switch to the `gh-pages` branch.
  1. If you're [using a custom domain name](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages), modify the `CNAME` file to point to your new domain.
  2. If you're not using a custom domain name, **modify the `baseurl` in `_config.yml`** to point to your GitHub Pages URL. Example: for a repo at `github.com/username/poole`, use `http://username.github.io/poole/`. **Be sure to include the trailing slash.**
3. Done! Head to your GitHub Pages URL or custom domain.

No matter your production or hosting setup, be sure to verify the `baseurl` option file and `CNAME` settings. Not applying this correctly can mean broken styles on your site.

### 4. Updating

Simply download from the [Lanyon repo](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) as a ZIP, and unzip the contents, overwriting everything EXCEPT the config.yml and README.md.

## Options

Poole includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.


### Rems, `font-size`, and scaling

Poole is built almost entirely with `rem`s (instead of pixels). `rem`s are like `em`s, but instead of building on the immediate parent's `font-size`, they build on the root element, `<html>`.

By default, we use the following:

```css
html {
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.5;
}
@media (min-width: 38em) {
  html {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
}

```

To easily scale your site's typography and components, simply customize the base `font-size`s here.
