title: "How to deal with long tables in Pensolve"
---

This is our first advanced feature, it's called a PENBREAK. 
Similar to a page break, it allows you to cut your spreadsheet into new sections vertically. 
This can really help when you have a long table of raw data, e.g. CPT data.

The Penbreak feature was created to allow you to include a long table on the same sheet as other calculations, without the table breaking up to flow of the calculations.

Check out the example below where the CPT data will now be presented at the end of the PDF.
