Charlie, Phil and I are fortunate enough to be part of Lightning Lab, a business accelerator programme. The business accelerator helps develop high growth businesses to revitalise Christchurch and establish it as a modern city.

Our business, Pensolve, is an innovative software which helps you review your spreadsheet calculations. Our target market is engineers, but we are not exclusive so if you use spreadsheets then you are welcome to trial our software at app.pensolve.com and let us know what you think.

Today we launched our first version of the software which converts your .xlsx file into a hand-calculation layout. We are rapidly developing the software so we will keep you up to date when we release major features.

Customer feedback helps us develop a product that is useful for you, so get in touch at <team@pensolve.com>.

Signing out,
