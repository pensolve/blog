title: "The difference between Force-based and Displacement-based design"
---

Maxim, Cofounder of Pensolve, has recently written an article about the (differences between the two major engineering design philosophies)[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/force-based-displacement-based-design-whats-maxim-millen?trk=mp-reader-card], force-based design and displacement-based design.

As displacement-based design becomes more widely used, it is important to understand the underlying differences between the two methods and to not combine the two methods in ways that would provide an inconsistent design.

Maxim provides (a full set of calculations)[https://app.pensolve.com/sources/instance/13] using Pensolve to demonstrate the different processes for the design of a bridge pier.
