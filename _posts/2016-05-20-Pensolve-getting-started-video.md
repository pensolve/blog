title: "Pensolve tutorial videos and branded PDF outputs"
---


This week we have started to make tutorial videos to demonstrate aspects of the Pensolve platform, such as creating an account or displaying tables correctly. Check out the [video on how to create an account](https://vimeo.com/166175754) or check out our video library at [http://pensolve.com/videos.html](http://pensolve.com/videos.html).

We have added support to have customised PDF layouts (for paying customers only), so that your firm can keep its unique brand.

Algorithm improvements
======================

We have fixed an issue with displaying IF statements and fixed an issue which stopped .xlsm files from processing. Please let us know if your file does not process and we will look into it immediately.
