The brand new version is ready for commercial use and it has a powerful new PDF view.

We have listened to our customers and now Pensolve is PDF based. The new layout is set up to look great as a printed document for consent submission and offline use.

The way we process your spreadsheets has dramatically improved, we now support a whole range of new excel features, including VLOOKUP tables and text inputs to equations.

Thanks for all your support over the last several months, we finally have a product we are proud of.
