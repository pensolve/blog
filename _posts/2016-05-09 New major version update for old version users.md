Hi << Test First Name >>!
Pensolve 2.0 is live
We have been a bit quiet lately because back in December we made a decision to rewrite our entire platform. Now the brand new version is ready for commercial use and it has a powerful new PDF view (see the video below).

We have listened to our customers and now Pensolve is PDF based. The new layout is set up to look great as a printed document for consent submission and offline use.
New algorithm
The way we process your spreadsheets has dramatically improved, we now support a whole range of new excel features, including VLOOKUP tables and text inputs to equations.
New login
The platform is live and ready for use! For security reasons, we have not transferred over the data from the old version, but you can sign up again here:

Thanks for all your support over the last several months, we finally have a product we are proud of.
