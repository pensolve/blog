A new publication prepared by the Canterbury Employers' Chamber of Commerce for New Zealand Trade and Entreprise has just been released. 
["Showcasing Canterbury's Collaborative Innovation"](http://collaboratecanterbury.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Booklet_Collaborate_Canterbury_NZ_Innovation_Showcase_May2016_Low.pdf) presents companies that have developed in the wake of the Canterbury 2010 and 2011 earthquakes. 
We are very proud of all of the companies that are part of this publication and pleased to see Christchurch growing as an innovative city.
