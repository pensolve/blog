Pensolve videos
This week we have started to make 2 minute tutorial videos to demonstrate aspects of the Pensolve platform, such as creating an account or displaying tables correctly. Check out the video below on how to create an account and convert your first file.
We have added support to have customised PDF layouts (for paying customers only), so that your firm can keeps its unique brand.
Algorithm improvements
We have fixed an issue with displaying IF statements and fixed an issue which stopped .xlsm files from processing. Please let us know if your file does not process and we will look into it immediately.
