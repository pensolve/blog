title: "How good is modal analysis"
---

Maxim, Cofounder of Pensolve, has produced another earthquake engineering article, this time about seismic modal analysis. 

Modal analysis has been a cornerstone of structural earthquake engineering ever since computers could build mass and stiffness matrices. 
While modal allows us to assess the effects of ground shaking across multiple frequencies, the question is, are we trusting too much in our numerical models,
