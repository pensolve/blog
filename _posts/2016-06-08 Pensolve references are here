Hi << Test First Name >>!

We have been published inside the Showcasing Canterbury's Collaborative Innovation magazine produced to highlight the innovations that have developed following the Christchurch earthquakes. If you see a copy then check us out or you can read the article online here: http://collaboratecanterbury.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Booklet_Collaborate_Canterbury_NZ_Innovation_Showcase_May2016_Low.pdf.
References in Pensolve
A lot of our customers have talked about the importance of referencing equations to either design standards or journal papers. The reference provides evidence about the validity of the equation and allows the reviewer to look at the actual source of the equation and read the surrounding text to see if there are any exceptions.

Now Pensolve uses a special indicator to format references, just include "Ref: " in front of any reference and it gets formatted in the right hand column as shown below.
Spreadsheet version comparison
We are also working on a major new feature, which allows you to do rapid review of spreadsheets. Because most engineers are solving unique problems they often have to modify a template spreadsheet. Unfortunately it can be extremely difficult to interpret how those modifications have affected the whole spreadsheet. Our new feature can compare two spreadsheets as a flow-map and show you just the changes in the calculations. We will be releasing it in the next few weeks but here is a short video showing how it will work.
Algorithm improvements
A series of small fixes have been made to display long equations, better display table calculations and the improved finding of section headers.
