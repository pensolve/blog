To include an image into Pensolve output you need to format a border to the image. Unfortunately this is quite tricky in Google Sheets.
This is a step-by-step guide on how to get an image to show up.

*Important: Only .JPG, .JPEG, .PNG images are supported in the Pensolve output.*

*Graphs/Charts and other editable images are not supported*
