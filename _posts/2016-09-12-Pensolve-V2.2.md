We have rolled out several updates in the last two weeks to refine the display of your calculations, including:
 
1. Added support for web links that are provided as calculation references, and making the web link clickable in the PDF output
2. Improved the display of VLOOKUP functions (see image below)
3. Added metadata to the PDF to integrate it more tightly with BlueBeam and Adobe
4. Support for in cell units
5. Better display of advanced excel functions (eg. COT)
6. Better spacing of table data, especially when it contains text.
