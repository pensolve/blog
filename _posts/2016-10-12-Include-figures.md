title: "How to include figures in Pensolve"
---

Including figures has been our most requested feature this year. 
The main issue is that some figures and various screenshots are not intended
 to go into the final design calculations while others are.

To tell Pensolve to include a figure you can now simply added a border
 to the figure and it will appear in the PDF in the same location as in the spreadsheet. 
 See the example below, you can see the corresponding PDF output 
 here under [Concrete beam design NZS3101.](https://app.pensolve.com/example-files/?ref=blogV2_3)

This feature is available for both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 

A full tutorial for Google Sheets can be found [here](http://pensolve.com/blog//2017/05/29/How-to-include-images-in-Pensolve-output-with-Google-sheets/)

The web app is automatically updated with these changes so you can make 
use of the latest version at [https://app.pensolve.com](https://app.pensolve.com)
