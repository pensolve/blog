title: "Introducing our Equation Dependency Tracking feature"
---
Pensolve users have sent in some great ideas in the last couple of weeks and we
have been working hard to implement as many as possible.

I want to tell you about one, that I am most proud of, our new equation
dependency tracking tool. When you are viewing equations in Pensolve, you can
now click on an equation and it will show you all of the inputs for that
equation. You can continue to do this, down to the initial constants used.
This is particularly useful for debugging a spreadsheet, where the
outputs don't quite look right.
