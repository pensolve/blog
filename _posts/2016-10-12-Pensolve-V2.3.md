We are excited to announce two major updates to Pensolve, 
the first one is for those of you who like to include pictures with your 
calculations (I hope this is everyone as it good practice). 
The second update is our first advanced feature, it's called a PENBREAK. 
Similar to a page break, it allows you to cut your spreadsheet into new sections vertically. 
This can really help when you have a long table of raw data, e.g. CPT data.

The web app is automatically updated with these changes so you can make 
use of the latest version at [https://app.pensolve.com](https://app.pensolve.com)

How to include figures in Pensolve
----------------------------------

Including figures has been our most requested feature this year. 
The main issue is that some figures and various screenshots are not intended
 to go into the final design calculations while others are.

To tell Pensolve to include a figure you can now simply added a border
 to the figure and it will appear in the PDF in the same location as in the spreadsheet. 
 See the example below, you can see the corresponding PDF output 
 here under [Concrete beam design NZS3101.](https://app.pensolve.com/example-files/?ref=blogV2_3)

This feature is available for both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.
