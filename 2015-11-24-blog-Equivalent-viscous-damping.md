title: "The concept of equivalent viscous damping"
---

Maxim, Cofounder of Pensolve, has recently written an earthquake engineering article about the pseudo property called equivalent viscous damping (EVD). 

Equivalent viscous damping is a widely used concept in seismic design and analysis across structural and geotechnical engineering. 
Unfortunately it is often misused as its application requires other assumptions which are often not followed. 
Learn more about the different ways that EVD is implemented across engineering in the [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/misconceptions-equivalent-viscous-damping-earthquake-maxim-millen?trk=mp-reader-card).
